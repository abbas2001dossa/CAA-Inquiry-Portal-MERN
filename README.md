# CAA-Inquiry-Portal-MERN

# Description
During my enriching internship experience at the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority, I had the privilege of contributing to two impactful phases. In the first phase, spanning three weeks, I undertook the development of a dynamic drag and drop project aimed at optimizing bay allocation. This challenging task honed my problem-solving skills 
and exposed me to the intricacies of creating intuitive user interfaces.
The second phase, also spanning three weeks, presented an exciting opportunity to collaborate with the Department of Inquiry Cell. 
My responsibilities encompassed gathering their requirements and devising an innovative solution to streamline their operations. 
Leveraging the power of the MERN (MySQL, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, I spearheaded the creation of a bespoke portal that significantly enhanced their 
workflow efficiency. This involved translating intricate user needs into functional features, resulting in an automated platform that facilitated seamless 
processes.

My time at the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority not only provided hands-on experience in software development and project management but also allowed me
to witness the tangible impact of technology on optimizing organizational workflows. 
I am proud to have contributed to projects that hold the potential to make a meaningful difference in the aviation sector.
